    The below example will use the same action in three ways, to "partition" followed by "formating" and finally mounting the disks. All of the different commands below `partition`/`format`/`mount`, will have their actions determined by the contents of the storage section in the metadata refer to the[Customer Partitioning and RAID](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/servers/custom-partitioning-raid/) documentation for more information.
