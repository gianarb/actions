Action is the repository that contains reusable Tinkerbell Actions and in the
near future Workflows maintained by the Tinkerbell community.

This is an ongoing and work in progress collaboration with
[ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io) a project sponsored by the CNCF.

To know more about the direction of the project have a look at proposal number
[0021](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/blob/main/proposals/0021/README.md)

...More will come I promise but if you are curious you can [join our contributors
meeting, or our Slack channel](https://tinkerbell.org/community/).

Action are currently maintained and built for:

-   `linux/amd64`
-   `linux/arm64`
-   `linux/arm/v7`

We are currently having some issues with `linux/arm/v6`, sorry for that.

## Contribution

... more will come...

## Development

To comfortably try and test this project you need to have nix and in particular
nix-shell installed.

You don't need to know how it works but we use it to double check that the
required files are there.
