description: "This action will stream a compressed filesystem archive into archive2disk
where it will mount a block device and uncompress this archive to a destination path on
it's filesystem. Usually the `DEST_PATH` should be `/` as we normally will be writing a
root filesystem, however it can be used to stream application data to a different area on
disk (such as preloading container images, or web server assets)."

The below example will stream a compressed root filesystem into archive2disk, where it
will be written to the filesystem on the block device `/dev/sda3`.

Archive types supported:

-   `tar`: standard tar archive
-   `targz`: A gzipped tar archive (compressed)

```yaml

      environment:
          ARCHIVE_URL: http://192.168.1.2/ubuntu.tar.gz
          ARCHIVE_TYPE: targz
          DEST_DISK: /dev/sda3
