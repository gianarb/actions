The below example will use the same action in three ways, to "partition" followed by "formating" and
finally mounting the disks. All of the different commands below `partition`/`format`/`mount`, will
have their actions determined by the contents of the storage section in the metadata refer to the
[Customer Partitioning and RAID](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/servers/custom-partitioning-raid/) documentation for more information.

```yaml
actions:
    - name: "disk-wipe-partition"
      image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
      timeout: 90
      command: ["partition"]
      environment:
          MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
    - name: "format"
      image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
      timeout: 90
      command: ["format"]
      environment:
          MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
    - name: "mount"
